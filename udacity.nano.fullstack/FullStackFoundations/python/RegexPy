## Opening and Closing files

Using reqular expressions allows for us to go into a file and look for patterns
to do this an option is to fist open the file

	# Opening
	names_file = open("name_of_file.txt", encoding="utf-8")

	# Reading 
	data = names_file.read()

	# Close 
	names_file.close()


## Using re.match
searches the begening of the string the 'r' represent raw text

	re.match(r'Love', data)

## Using re.search
searches the entire string 
	
	re.search(r'Love', data)

## Sets 
[aple] finds apple
[a-z] finds all lowercase letters from a to z
[^2]

## re Finding emails in a Set

	def find_emails(str):
		return re.findall(r'[-\w\d+.]+@[-\w\d.]+', str)

just like finding you can also ignore chars or sets here we ignore gov in emails
using negative sets


re.I is used to catch any case
	re.findall(r'''
	    \b@[-\w\d.]* # first a word boundy an @ and then any number of chars
	    [^gov\t]+ # ignore instances of the letters 'g', 'o' and 'v'  and tab
	    \b # match the word boundry again
	    ''', data, re.VERBOSE|re.I) # verbose is used when multiple lines are used
	    # The bar is used to add one or more flags

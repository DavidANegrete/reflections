The goal is to steamline the development process by insuring that there is always a working prototype available. 

Steps to Complete
1. Mock Ups
	- Create pages HTML for each page and URLs
2. Routing
	-	Set up routing to insure that the pages can be accessed even if not complete (HTML)
3. Templates and Forms
	-	On this iteration all templates and forms will be created
4. CRUD (Functionality)
	-	Make sure the DB can be accessed. 
5. API Endpoints
	- 	Create JSON implementations if requested.
6. Styling and Flash
	-	This is focused on delivering a cleaned up and UX focused application.

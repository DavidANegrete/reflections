# Updating a Linux Box


The current packages on a box can be found in:

	'/etc/apt/source.list'


Package source lists in a Linux distro can be checked like so, as sudo:

	'sudo apt-get update'

	Note: this only checks that the disctros are flagged with the current 
	updates available


To push the update through:

	'sudo apt-get upgrade'


# Remove packages that are not needed

	'sudo apt-get autoremove'

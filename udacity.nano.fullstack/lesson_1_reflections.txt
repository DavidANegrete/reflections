How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me by allowing me to quickly see the differences in the two files, since it was a wholcde bunch of code this code have taken a whole lot longer. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you ever need to see how the old version worked before changes were made you can pull them up to view them. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Doing it when you want you can insure that commits are done when they need to and not randomly when the system has it set up. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Code is interelated and sometimes changes have to be made in many different files in order for the uptates to fuction

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

because you can always revert you can make changes knowing that you can always go back to the way it was

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you do this you create a metadata holder and make the directory a git directory. You need this to get a directory started..
